Problems with libs:
- Currently, libPxrPlatform does not attach and/or create a "oculus display" and "oculus input".
This causes an error with starting up, and will throw a "failed to initialize" into the console.
Using a different libpxr_api, from the Beatsaber mod will make it work (How did the guy edit the string in there???)

- libpxr_api, for some reason calls SysActivity (tf is this?), which is a Java class that is not bundled with the application, so it just gives up and throws an error.
I just patched that one with NOP's, cause I can.

Trying to patch a game like Waltz of Wizards, probably wont work, it's throwing errors with its voice API, aswell as just showing a blank screen.
It did work however with a tiny Oculus game.
Needs more research :(
